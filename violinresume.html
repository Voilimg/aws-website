      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about" id="lineh">I have loved music since childhood, learning the violin at the age of 6, and learning to broadcast and host at the age of 10. In 1990, I won the first prize in the "Chunmiao Cup" Children's Violin Competition in Changchun City, and the second prize in the Changchun Youth Violin Competition in 1995. Graduated from the first vocational high school in Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province in 1999.
        Since 2010, when I was teaching violin in Shenzhen, I participated in violin master classes all over the country to learn violin skills and teaching methods, and accumulated rich experience in orchestra performance and violin teaching. Students and parents have been given high recognition and praise, and they are caring, patient, and responsible for students. At the same time, I love singing, broadcasting, and hosting performances. The experience of thousands of performances has created a confident, comfortable, and unique stage style. Loved and supported by everyone.</p>
